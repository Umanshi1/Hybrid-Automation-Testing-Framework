# Hybrid-Automation-Testing-Framework

Overview: 
This project is a scalable hybrid automation testing framework that integrates Data-Driven and Keyword-Driven testing approaches. It is designed to automate web applications efficiently while maintaining high readability, reusability, and scalability.
The framework is built using Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and Cucumber BDD, and follows industry-standard best practices such as the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.

Key Features:
1. Hybrid framework combining Data-Driven and Keyword-Driven testing
2. Cucumber BDD for readable and maintainable test scenarios
3. Page Object Model (POM) for better code reusability and maintenance
4. Cross-browser testing support
5. External test data handling using Apache POI (Excel)
6. Detailed test execution reports using ExtentReports
7. Screenshot capture on test failure
8. Logging and browser management utilities
9. Git-based version control

Purpose of This Project:
This framework was developed to demonstrate hands-on experience in:
1. Designing scalable automation frameworks
2. Applying industry-standard automation best practices
3. Writing maintainable and reusable test automation code
It is suitable for real-world enterprise-level automation testing scenarios.
